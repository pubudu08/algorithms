Simple Linear Regression
    Y = b0 + b1 * X1
        Y = Dependent var
        X1 = Independent Var
        b1 = Coefficient
        b0 = Constant

Multiple Linear Regression
    Y = b0 + b1 * X1 + b2 * X2 + b3 * X3 ... + bn * Xn



Salary data set:
IV : R&D, Admin, Marketing , State
DV: Profit
How much did the company in a given financial year that iven financial year a company
Problem: There is a venture capitalist fund wants to analyse these 50 companies over
analyze data set and create a model that will tell that VC fund which type of companies it should
 interested investing in, their main criteria is the profit.
 model which will tell me about profit based on R&D, Admin, Marketing , State,
 bear in mind the VC fund is not looking to invest in all 50 companies
 VC wants to understand, for an instance, in NY or CA all other things held equal or
 which companies perform better

 What are the co-relations between IVs which influance on DV


So many columns in data streams nowadays, some of the columns are useless we have to throw away
    1. Garbage in garbage out - If you throw in lots of stuff into your model then model will not be a good model,
    it won't be reliable, it won't be doing it supposed to be doing
    2. Explain the variables and understand the Math behind them but actually what it means that certain vars predicts
     the behaviours of your dependent var and you will have to explain that your superiors,
     if you have a thousand vars is not goinf to be practical to try and explain that.

     You need to keep vars that actually predict something.
