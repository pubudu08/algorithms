Simple Linear Regression
    Y = b0 + b1 * X1
        Y = Dependent var
        X1 = Independent Var
        b1 = Coefficient
        b0 = Constant

Multiple Linear Regression
    Y = b0 + b1 * X1 + b2 * X2 + b3 * X3 ... + bn * Xn



Salary data set:
IV : R&D, Admin, Marketing , State
DV: Profit
How much did the company in a given financial year that iven financial year a company
Problem: There is a venture capitalist fund wants to analyse these 50 companies over

 bear in mind the VC fund is not looking to invest in all 50 companies
 VC wants to understand, for an instance, in NY or CA all other things held equal or
 which companies perform better

 What are the co-relations between IVs which influance on DV

Y = b0 + b1 * X1 + b2 * X2 + b3 * X3
